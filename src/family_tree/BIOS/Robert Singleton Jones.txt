Born across the river from the Pleasant Hill Church Cemetery. The doctor who delivered him adopted him, and took him to South Carolina. When he grew up, he walked back to Winder GA to live. The creek was up when he died, so he couldn't be buried with his wife in the Lebanon Cemetery. Died Nov 21 1912.
